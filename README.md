# ü¶á About Me ‚õì
Hi! <br>I'm JJ, a computer science student at ASU who aspires to become a software engineer. <br><br>My love for technology and video games has led me down the path of programming, where I have discovered the limitless potential of coding. My interest in it began when I was 16 and created a client-sided skin changer hack on CS:GO with the help of an online cheating forum and tutorials I found on YouTube. I ended up receiving a permanent ban, and despite this mistake, I found it incredibly satisfying to create something from scratch and being able to apply it to or even transform people's lives (in my case, it was just having flashy pixelated cosmetics). <br><br>In addition to programming, I have a few other hobbies, including music production, reading novels, getting the highest rank in whatever game I hyperfixate on in the moment, and fashion. I often spend my free time working on passion projects that I believe accurately reflects the type of person that I am and view my work as windows to my character.<br><br>Here is where you'll catch a small glimpse into my mind of mine. :]
